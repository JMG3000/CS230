Software Design Document Reflection

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client for this project was The Gaming Room, a company seeking to expand its existing game, Draw It or Lose It, from an Android-only application into a web-based, cross-platform experience. The software needed to support multiple teams and players, enforce unique game and team names, and maintain a single active game instance at a time. Key requirements included scalability, security, and compatibility across operating systems such as Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile environments through a client-server architecture.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

One area I performed particularly well in was clearly analyzing and documenting the system architecture and platform considerations. I effectively compared operating systems and deployment environments, which helped justify architectural decisions related to scalability, security, and performance. This documentation created a strong foundation for understanding how the application would function across multiple platforms.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through the design document was especially helpful because it forced me to think through system constraints, user interactions, and architectural trade-offs before writing code. By planning class structure, data management, and deployment strategies ahead of time, I was able to reduce ambiguity during implementation and better align the code with the project requirements.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise one part of my work, I would expand the security section of the document. While I addressed authentication and authorization at a high level, I would improve it by adding more detail about threat mitigation, secure communication practices, and data protection strategies. This would strengthen the overall design by more thoroughly addressing real-world security concerns.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on simplicity, accessibility, and reliability. These needs were implemented through design choices such as enforcing unique identifiers, using a centralized server model, and supporting multiple client platforms. Considering user needs is critical because software that does not align with user expectations often fails regardless of technical quality. User-centered design ensures the application is both functional and usable.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

My approach to designing the software emphasized modularity, scalability, and clear separation of concerns. I relied on object-oriented principles, UML diagrams, and architectural comparisons to guide decision-making. In future projects, I would continue using these strategies while also incorporating more iterative feedback and early prototyping to validate design decisions sooner in the development process.
